    /**
     * Joins with the specified relations.
     *
     * This method allows you to reuse existing relation definitions to perform JOIN queries.
     * Based on the definition of the specified relation(s), the method will append one or multiple
     * JOIN statements to the current query.
     *
     * If the `$eagerLoading` parameter is true, the method will also perform eager loading for the specified relations,
     * which is equivalent to calling [[with()]] using the specified relations.
     *
     * Note that because a JOIN query will be performed, you are responsible to disambiguate column names.
     *
     * This method differs from [[with()]] in that it will build up and execute a JOIN SQL statement
     * for the primary table. And when `$eagerLoading` is true, it will call [[with()]] in addition with the
     * specified relations.
     *
     * @param string|array $with the relations to be joined. This can either be a string, representing a relation name
     * or an array with the following semantics:
     *
     * - Each array element represents a single relation.
     * - You may specify the relation name as the array key and provide an anonymous functions that
     *   can be used to modify the relation queries on-the-fly as the array value.
     * - If a relation query does not need modification, you may use the relation name as the array value.
     *
     * The relation name may optionally contain an alias for the relation table (e.g. `books b`).
     *
     * Sub-relations can also be specified, see [[with()]] for the syntax.
     *
     * In the following you find some examples:
     *
     * ```php
     * // find all orders that contain books, and eager loading "books"
     * Order::find()->joinWith('books', true, 'INNER JOIN')->all();
     * // find all orders, eager loading "books", and sort the orders and books by the book names.
     * Order::find()->joinWith([
     *     'books' => function (\yii\db\ActiveQuery $query) {
     *         $query->orderBy('item.name');
     *     }
     * ])->all();
     * // find all orders that contain books of the category 'Science fiction', using the alias "b" for the books table
     * Order::find()->joinWith(['books b'], true, 'INNER JOIN')->where(['b.category' => 'Science fiction'])->all();
     * ```
     *
     * The alias syntax is available since version 2.0.7.
     *
     * @param bool|array $eagerLoading whether to eager load the relations
     * specified in `$with`.  When this is a boolean, it applies to all
     * relations specified in `$with`. Use an array to explicitly list which
     * relations in `$with` need to be eagerly loaded.  Note, that this does
     * not mean, that the relations are populated from the query result. An
     * extra query will still be performed to bring in the related data.
     * Defaults to `true`.
     * @param string|array $joinType the join type of the relations specified in `$with`.
     * When this is a string, it applies to all relations specified in `$with`. Use an array
     * in the format of `relationName => joinType` to specify different join types for different relations.
     * @return $this the query object itself
     * @since 1.0.0

     * only one row of data is returned. For example,
     *
     * ```php
     * $query = (new Query)->from('user');
     * foreach ($query->each() as $row) {
